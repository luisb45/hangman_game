# hangman_game

This is a simple game of hangman I created to practice my Javascript skills. In this game, two players will take turns to try to guess a hidden word that is picked randomly. The player will only receive the amount of letters for each word and will guess using buttons that represent a letter. If the word is guessed without making 5 wrong guesses, then the player will receive a point. When a player makes 5 wrong guesses, they get no points and the round will continue for the next player. Whoever has the most points after 6 rounds wins. 

No frameworks used

Build with Javascript, HTML, and CSS
